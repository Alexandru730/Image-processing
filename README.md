# Dog Image Processing

This project demonstrates image processing techniques (mirror and edge detection) on random dog images using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Functionality

- The application fetches a random dog image from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).
- The original image is displayed on an HTML5 Canvas element.
- After a 1-second delay, the image is mirrored and edge detection is applied.
- Execution times for each step are recorded and displayed in the browser.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file with the main structure of the webpage.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for image fetching, processing, and display.
- `styles.css`: CSS file with minimal styling for the webpage.
